# CSS-for-Obsidian-Media-Extended
There is always a visual problem in the media extension of Obsidian. This occurs when we watch a video with a white background, making the buttons seem like they disappear due to their colors. This causes some working troubles.

I extracted some CSS styles from the CSS file of the media extension plugin to solve the problem that the play button, pause button, mute button, etc. seemed to disappear when they appeared in the video with a white background.

## 2.2 White background main color video

Just download this CSS file and place it in the snippets folder of Obsidian. Then, refresh the appearance in Obsidian to apply it. 

Please remember that this plugin is used based on the Media Extended plugin of Obsidian. To download this plugin, please visit the author's GitHub repository: https://github.com/PKM-er/media-extended.
